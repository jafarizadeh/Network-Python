# udpchat/packet_spec.py
"""
Defines required fields for each supported packet type.
This central schema allows the server (and potentially client)
to validate incoming data before processing.

Benefits:
- Consistent packet format across client and server
- Easier to modify protocol (single source of truth)
- Protects against malformed or incomplete messages
